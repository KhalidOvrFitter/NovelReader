00:01:19,312 --> 00:01:19,425
have

219
00:01:19,437 --> 00:01:19,887
forgotten

220
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:20,137
about

221
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:20,287
his

222
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:20,625
spear

223
00:01:20,637 --> 00:01:20,975
before

224
00:01:20,987 --> 00:01:21,412
dying

225
00:01:21,662 --> 00:01:21,812
his

226
00:01:21,825 --> 00:01:22,150
body

227
00:01:22,162 --> 00:01:22,612
swallowed

228
00:01:22,625 --> 00:01:22,762
by

229
00:01:22,775 --> 00:01:22,850
the

230
00:01:22,862 --> 00:01:23,387
imprisoned

231
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:23,787
ocean

232
00:01:24,087 --> 00:01:24,250
but

233
00:01:24,262 --> 00:01:24,625
Sunny

234
00:01:24,637 --> 00:01:24,812
had

235
00:01:24,825 --> 00:01:25,237
not

236
00:01:26,112 --> 00:01:26,575
So

237
00:01:26,812 --> 00:01:26,937
he

238
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:27,350
ventured

239
00:01:27,362 --> 00:01:27,587
into

240
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,075
frozen

241
00:01:28,087 --> 00:01:28,650
wastelands

242
00:01:28,662 --> 00:01:28,975
hoping

243
00:01:28,987 --> 00:01:29,075
to

244
00:01:29,087 --> 00:01:29,412
find

245
00:01:29,425 --> 00:01:29,637
it

246
00:01:30,512 --> 00:01:31,075
Luckily

247
00:01:31,212 --> 00:01:31,787
discovering

248
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:31,887
the

249
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:32,550
battlefield

250
00:01:32,562 --> 00:01:32,687
from

251
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:32,850
his

252
00:01:32,862 --> 00:01:33,212
vision

253
00:01:33,225 --> 00:01:33,375
had

254
00:01:33,387 --> 00:01:33,587
not

255
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:33,750
been

256
00:01:33,762 --> 00:01:33,975
too

257
00:01:33,987 --> 00:01:34,525
difficult

258
00:01:34,875 --> 00:01:35,000
at

259
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:35,275
least

260
00:01:35,287 --> 00:01:35,512
not

261
00:01:35,525 --> 00:01:35,675
for

262
00:01:35,687 --> 00:01:36,087
Sunny

263
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:36,550
who

264
00:01:36,562 --> 00:01:36,725
could

265
00:01:36,737 --> 00:01:37,087
cast

266
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:37,200
his

267
00:01:37,212 --> 00:01:37,612
shadow

268
00:01:37,625 --> 00:01:37,950
sense

269
00:01:37,962 --> 00:01:38,337
across

270
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:38,775
numerous

271
00:01:38,787 --> 00:01:39,437
kilometers

272
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:39,587
and

273
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:39,875
move

274
00:01:39,887 --> 00:01:40,025
with

275
00:01:40,037 --> 00:01:40,662
breathtaking

276
00:01:40,675 --> 00:01:41,162
speed

277
00:01:42,037 --> 00:01:42,425
After

278
00:01:42,437 --> 00:01:42,737
all

279
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,125
there

280
00:01:43,137 --> 00:01:43,225

00:01:43,525 --> 00:01:43,750
lot

284
00:01:43,762 --> 00:01:43,850
of

285
00:01:43,862 --> 00:01:44,337
places

286
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:44,487
where

287
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:44,587
the

288
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,000
sky

289
00:01:45,012 --> 00:01:45,175
was

290
00:01:45,187 --> 00:01:45,625
shattered

291
00:01:45,637 --> 00:01:45,775

292
00:01:45,787 --> 00:01:46,275
tendrils

293
00:01:46,287 --> 00:01:46,387

00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:46,912
nothingness

295
00:01:46,925 --> 00:01:47,237
seeped

296
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:47,462
into

00:01:47,475 --> 00:01:48,075
reality

298
00:01:48,387 --> 00:01:48,637
even

299
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:48,725
in

300
00:01:48,737 --> 00:01:48,825
the

301
00:01:48,837 --> 00:01:49,137
Dream

302
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:49,575
Realm

303
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:51,087
Surviving

304
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:51,262
that

305
00:01:51,275 --> 00:01:51,775
harrowing

306
00:01:51,787 --> 00:01:52,250
place

307
00:01:52,425 --> 00:01:52,900
however

308
00:01:53,187 --> 00:01:53,350
that

309
00:01:53,362 --> 00:01:53,500
was

310
00:01:53,512 --> 00:01:53,600
an

311
00:01:53,612 --> 00:01:54,212
entirely

312
00:01:54,225 --> 00:01:54,562
different

313
00:01:54,575 --> 00:01:55,012
matter

314
00:01:55,887 --> 00:01:56,387
Thousands

315
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:56,475
of

316
00:01:56,487 --> 00:01:56,837
years

317
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:57,000
had

318
00:01:57,012 --> 00:01:57,387
passed

319
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:57,625
since

320
00:01:57,637 --> 00:01:57,762
the

321
00:01:57,775 --> 00:01:57,987
day

322
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,150
he

323
00:01:58,162 --> 00:01:58,462
saw

324
00:01:58,475 --> 00:01:58,562
in

325
00:01:58,575 --> 00:01:58,637
the

00:01:58,650 --> 00:01:58,987
vision

327
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,087
of

328
00:01:59,100 --> 00:01:59,550
truth

329
00:01:59,837 --> 00:01:59,950
and

330
00:01:59,962 --> 00:02:00,025
the

331
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:00,587
entire

332
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:00,937
area

333
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:01,075
had

00:02:01,087 --> 00:02:01,425
become

335
00:02:01,437 --> 00:02:01,737
far

336
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:02,012
more

337
00:02:02,025 --> 00:02:02,350
eerie

338
00:02:02,362 --> 00:02:02,475
and

339
00:02:02,487 --> 00:02:03,187
terrifying

340
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:03,687
not

341
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:03,787
to

342
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,187
mention

343
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:04,650
chillingly

344
00:02:04,662 --> 00:02:05,100
lethal

345
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:05,462
than

346
00:02:05,475 --> 00:02:05,587
it

347
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:05,825
used

348
00:02:05,837 --> 00:02:05,900
to

349
00:02:05,912 --> 00:02:06,250
be

350
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:07,612
Everything

351
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:07,762
was

352
00:02:07,775 --> 00:02:08,225
swallowed

353
00:02:08,237 --> 00:02:08,387
by

354
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:08,537
the

355
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:08,887
ice

356
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:09,037
and

357
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:09,437
bathed

358
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:09,512
in

359
00:02:09,525 --> 00:02:09,587
the

360
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,150
familiar

361
00:02:10,162 --> 00:02:10,400
white

362
00:02:10,412 --> 00:02:10,800
mist

363
00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:11,362
only

364
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:11,787
something

365
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,087
seemed

366
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:12,162
to

367
00:02:12,175 --> 00:02:12,287
be

368
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:12,687
hiding

369
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:12,762
in

370
00:02:12,775 --> 00:02:12,850
the

371
00:02:12,862 --> 00:02:13,150
mist

372
00:02:13,162 --> 00:02:13,387
there

373
00:02:13,687 --> 00:02:13,987
making

374
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,125
his

375
00:02:14,137 --> 00:02:14,425

376
00:02:14,437 --> 00:02:14,912

377
00:02:15,787 --> 00:02:15,950
The

00:02:15,962 --> 00:02:16,612
unbearable

379
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:16,962
cold

380
00:02:16,975 --> 00:02:17,125
was

381
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:17,562
almost

382
00:02:17,575 --> 00:02:18,175
absolute

383
00:02:18,487 --> 00:02:18,787
far

384
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,087
worse

385
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:19,262
than

386
00:02:19,275 --> 00:02:19,487
even

387
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:19,587
the

388
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:19,900
Winter

389
00:02:19,912 --> 00:02:20,312
Beast's

390
00:02:20,325 --> 00:02:20,712
blizzard

391
00:02:20,725 --> 00:02:20,912

00:02:20,925 --> 00:02:21,250
been

393
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:22,550
Sunny

394
00:02:22,562 --> 00:02:22,712
had

395
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:23,000
wanted

396
00:02:23,012 --> 00:02:23,112
to

397
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:23,612
explore

398
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:23,712
the

399
00:02:23,725 --> 00:02:24,350
battlefield

400
00:02:24,362 --> 00:02:24,862
thoroughly

401
00:02:25,175 --> 00:02:25,312
but

402
00:02:25,325 --> 00:02:25,400
in

403
00:02:25,412 --> 00:02:25,475
the

404
00:02:25,487 --> 00:02:25,825
end

405
00:02:26,112 --> 00:02:26,225
he

406
00:02:26,237 --> 00:02:26,587
barely

407
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,025
managed

408
00:02:27,037 --> 00:02:27,125
to

409
00:02:27,137 --> 00:02:27,525
retrieve

410
00:02:27,537 --> 00:02:27,625
the

411
00:02:27,637 --> 00:02:28,025
spear

412
00:02:28,037 --> 00:02:28,225
from

413
00:02:28,237 --> 00:02:28,512
deep

414
00:02:28,525 --> 00:02:28,762
within

415
00:02:28,775 --> 00:02:28,875

417
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:29,562
before

418
00:02:29,575 --> 00:02:30,062
hastily

419
00:02:30,075 --> 00:02:30,412
making

420
00:02:30,425 --> 00:02:30,475
a

422
00:02:31,912 --> 00:02:32,062
The

423
00:02:32,075 --> 00:02:32,462
spear

424
00:02:32,475 --> 00:02:32,625

425
00:02:32,637 --> 00:02:32,787
been

426
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,425
gigantic

00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:34,050
first

429
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:34,375
but

430
00:02:34,387 --> 00:02:34,512
as

431
00:02:34,525 --> 00:02:34,750
soon

432
00:02:34,762 --> 00:02:34,850

00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:13,412
So

Preferably
